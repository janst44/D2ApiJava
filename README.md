TODO:
Add entire record to a database for future ML (synergies and counters detailed like even items)
Add grid visualization (red/green) with adjustable drag scrolls as thresholds for min and max win rate threshold exclusion to filter results (frontend)
Of the top 5 counters, who appears the most? Which hero's have the least significant counters and high win rate? Create a dream team pool of few hero's, some labeled first pick, others situational counter.
Make final pick smarter(Maximize likely hood of not being countered(popularity of other counters) and boosting if countering previous 4)
